# HelpieChallenge

Concept challenge for an app creation using RxJava and others libraries:

Create an Android app with a menu that contains at the bottom two items ("Users" and "Photos"). When "Users" is selected, retrieve a list of all users in alphabetic order with the following content: Id, Name, E-mail, CompanyName and City. After that, when an user is selected, open another screen retrieving all the posts from that particular user.

When "Photos" is selected, create a gallery that shows the images and the image should be zoomed in when touched.

Consume the following APIs:

-Users: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

-Posts: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?userId={userId}

-Photos: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos
